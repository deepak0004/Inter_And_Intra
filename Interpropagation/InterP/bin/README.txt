?: initialised with unknown value (Integer.parseInt(args[0]))

Operations follow this rule. First row and col is irrelevant (just making 1 based index).

I am printing extra variables (of all assignments), kndly just look the relevant ones.
No array input is expected.	
There should be a main class set. Variables in method should be properly described(dependent on function parameter or taking accurate values, it shouldn't be case that any undescribed variable not initialised is being taken) .
